# Introduction

This vignette provides an overview and usage examples for the `lab4` package, which implements multiple linear regression using ordinary least squares. The package includes a reference class `linreg` with methods to fit a linear regression model, access model statistics, and visualize the results.


# Installation

To install the `linreg` package, you can use the following R code:


<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("https://github.com/ductr388/lab4") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Getting Started -->

<!-- To begin, we need to load the `lab4package` package and create an instance of the linreg reference class that takes two arguments "formula" and "data". For the inputs, "formula needs to be a *formula*-class and "data" needs to be a *data frame*-class with columns spelled the same as in the "formula".   -->
<!-- We will demonstrate the basic usage of the package with a sample dataset `iris` where *Petal.Length* is the response variable and *Sepal.Width* & *Sepal.Length* are the dependent variables. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(lab4package) -->
<!-- model <- linreg$new(formula = Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Sepal.Length, data = iris) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The linear regression is saved in `model` which will be used throughout the vignette. -->


<!-- # Accessing Model Information -->

<!-- You can access various information about the model using the methods provided by the linreg class. For example, to access the model coefficients you can use: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- model$coef() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If you also want to include the formula that the model is using you can use: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- model$print() -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- If you want to print a summary of the model that includes the estimated coefficients, their standard errors, t-values, and p-values you can use `summary()`. Significance codes (\*\*\*, \*\*, \*) are used to indicate the level of significance for each coefficient. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- model$summary() -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- You can use the `pred()` method to obtain the predicted values from the regression model. These values represent the model's predictions for each observation in the dataset.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- head(model$pred()) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can also use `resid()` method to access the residuals from the regression model. Residuals represent the differences between the observed values and the predicted values. -->


<!-- ```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4} -->
<!-- head(model$resid()) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Visualizing the Results -->

<!-- The `lab4package` package includes a plot method to visualize the results of the regression model. This method generates two plots: Residuals vs. Fitted values and Scale-Location plot.  -->

<!-- ```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4} -->
<!-- model$plot() -->
<!-- ``` -->
